### Personal Note
 I was not aware that this project was to be done in this format becaue I did not read through the entire ReadMe.  I got tutoring on monday from bootcamp and figured out that I had a lot of work to do to re do all of my code.  I hired a friend of mine to tutor me today, and we spend 5 hours going over all of this.  I feel much better now, and this was a big learning experience for me.
